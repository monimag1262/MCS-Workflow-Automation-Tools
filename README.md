Custom Tampermonkey scripts I built to automate and streamline daily operations
📋 Overview
As a Transportation Specialist at Amazon, I identified several repetitive tasks and manual processes that slowed down daily operations. To solve these problems, I built a suite of custom Tampermonkey scripts that automate workflows, surface critical information faster, and reduce human error.

These tools are actively used and maintained — I update them regularly through GitHub.
